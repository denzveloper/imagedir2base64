# imagedir2base64
Get image on a directory then optimize to Webp 70% quality (chrome based browser) or jpeg 80% quality (other based browser) and encode to base64


just call this file then call function with directory.

ex: show('/assets/path/to/image.png')


Tested on system: Manjaro Linux, php73, Apache

*Maybe load page longer than usual because waiting for render image first*
